Piwik Statistic Integration

This module provides a field that can be attached to any node.
It requests statistical data from your piwik installation and
saves it in the node it is attached to.

It is still under development but you can already use it for
building Top-lists (using Views 3) or output statistics by theming.


-- REQUIREMENTS --
